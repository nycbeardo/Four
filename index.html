  <h3>A Visual Analysis of Assignment Three
  </h3>

  <p>In the third assignment given, we were tasked with developing a word count that checked for frequency of words within a song of our choice. </p>
  <br>
<p>This assignment was done in Java using hash maps as the more logical choice to carry put this task given its use of key values and the ability to access those values in a search more easily as opposed to other methods. </p>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<br>
<p>I choose Lift Yourself because it was a reference point in pop culture where most people, regardless of if you love or hate Kanye, was hanging on his every move. 
  Also the desire to see new material from him was at a all time high and this song was practically a troll on those who were complaining about the radio silence.</p>
  <br> 
 <p>The top words from what you saw up top were basically complete gibberish but showed a level of coherence and consistency in what little arrangement is present. </p>
<br>
  <p>If I had more time, I would've done more with showing actual visualization using p5.js which was the plan given my academic focus on multimedia & creative programming.</p> 
<br>
  <p> A pie chart pulling information from a JSON file would have shown the results in the way that I wanted.</p>
